         I was born in Mexico City, Mexico, and raised in Perris, California, by my 
         wonderful mother. From Perris, CA, I moved to Berkeley, CA, where I spent my 
         undergraduate years studying Ethnic Studies and Computer Science. During my 
         time at Berkeley, I worked at my campus theater, led the Hispanic Engineers 
         and Scientists Club, volunteered by teaching acting to local K-12 students, 
         and spent a summer interning at Microsoft on the Xbox Game Bar team working
         on creating widgets using the Game Bar standard development kit (SDK). Right
         after college, I moved to Seattle, Washington, to work full time at Microsoft 
         on the Xbox PC Fundamentals team where I worked on the PC Xbox application.
